# FB Detox

A simple Google Chrome extension that automatically hides Facebook Like buttons from web pages.

This does not prevent any tracking code from running. You should use another extension or technique for that. I prefer to edit the `/etc/hosts` file and add the following line:

    127.0.0.1	www.facebook.com

This blocks all requests to Facebook.
